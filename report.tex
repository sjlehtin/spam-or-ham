\section{Abstract}
% Include the key points of your work in a few sentences (including methods
% used and conclusions).
We trained a univariate binary classification tree to detect spam email.


\section{Rationale}

The choice of using a decision tree to solve a task with boolean variables
seemed natural. Such a tree could definitely match whatever complexity there
would be in the training data.
In fact we figured our success would be determined mainly by how we would
manage to avoid overfitting.

Decision trees were also tempting in that they are much easier to
visualize than, e.g., naive bayes classifiers.  For example, see
\XXX{references to figures}

\section{Principles of decision trees}

Decision trees are a non-parametric method for data classification.
They don't try to approximate any model behind the data, instead relying
on tactic of ``similar inputs produce similar outputs''.

\subsection{Calculating impurity}

We chose to measure impurity with the entropy function \XXX{proper
citing} (Quinlan 1986)
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
\mathcal{I}_m &= - \sum_{i=1}^K p_m^i \log_2 p_m^i  \\
\text{for a node} \quad & m  \\
\text{where} \quad 0 \log 0 &\equiv 0  \\
p_m^i &= P(\text{Instance reaching node m belongs to class i})  \\
K &= 2
\end{split}
\end{equation*}

\subsection{Pruning the tree}

Decision trees can be trained to perfectly match the training
data\cite[\XXX{page number}]{alpaydin2004}.  This will lead the model to
gross overfitting, which manifests as a large generalization error.
This can be avoided by pruning the tree.  There are two non-exclusive
approaches to pruning, prepruning and postpruning.

Without pruning, a tree could look like \XXX{ref to non-pruned figure}
with a training set size of 1000.

\XXX{table of errors with a tree without pruning}

\subsubsection{Prepruning}

In prepruning, the recursion of the training algorithm is stopped once
certain limits are reached.  Examples include obtained impurity and number
of data rows.

In our first versions of the classifier we only did prepruning, which
resulted in very small and tidy trees, but the accuracy left a lot to be
desired. \XXX{some data} Current model uses one of the suggested
approaches from \cite{alpaydin2004}, where we make the tree as pure as
possible (no prepruning) and handle overfitting by postpruning the tree.
Removing prepruning didn't have an adverse effect for the final
accuracy. \XXX{data}

When prepruning, we stopped the algorithm by limiting by the results
from the entropy calculation, by columns (features) and rows (messages)
left in a recursion step.  For example, \XXX{more detailed explanation}.

\XXX{table of errors with a prepruned tree}

\subsubsection{Postpruning}
\label{sect:postpruning}

Postpruning is used to reduce generalization error by using a a special
pruning data set to check whether removing a subtree from the decision
tree will result in the same or smaller error against the pruning set.

\section{Validation of our approach}

\subsection{K-fold cross validation}

We implemented 10-fold cross validation to our classifier.  This
gave more stable values for generalization error when compared to
repeatedly training the classifier without the cross validation.

One part of the training data set was used for postpruning the tree, see
section \ref{sect:postpruning}.

\section{Conclusions}

The chosen approach didn't achieve the same high marks for accuracy as
the winners of the data challenge.  Tweaking of the approach is
naturally possible, but it seems that decision trees are more suited in
this as a part of combined classifier instead of on their own.  This
does not mean that the approach is completely without merits; decision
trees were applied here without prior knowledge to the distribution of
the spam messages.  In the data challenge, the winning teams had tweaked
the prior probabilities for spam to match the distribution in the data
set.  In the decision tree model, this is not not necessary, or even
possible.

Looking at the generated decision trees, it is easy to follow the
process by eye.  This, we think, helps a lot in validating the approach.
