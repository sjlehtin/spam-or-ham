\section{Abstract}
% Include the key points of your work in a few sentences (including methods
% used and conclusions).
We trained a univariate binary classification tree to detect spam email.


\section{Rationale}

The choice of using a decision tree to solve a task with boolean variables
seemed natural. Such a tree could definitely match whatever complexity there
would be in the training data.
In fact we figured our success would be determined mainly by how we would
manage to avoid overfitting.

Decisiontrees were also tempting in that they are much easier to
visualize than, e.g., naive bayes classifiers.  For example, see
\XXX{references to figures}

\section{Principles of decision trees}

Decision trees are a non-parametric method for data classification.
They don't try to approximate any model behind the data, instead relying
on tactic of ``similar inputs produce similar outputs''.

\subsection{Calculating impurity}

We chose to measure impurity with the entropy function \XXX{proper
citing} (Quinlan 1986)
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
\mathcal{I}_m &= - \sum_{i=1}^K p_m^i \log_2 p_m^i  \\
\text{for a node} \quad & m  \\
\text{where} \quad 0 \log 0 &\equiv 0  \\
p_m^i &= P(\text{Instance reaching node m belongs to class i})  \\
K &= 2
\end{split}
\end{equation*}

\subsection{Pruning the tree}

\subsubsection{Prepruning}

In our first versions of the classifier we only did prepruning, which
resulted in very small and tidy trees, but the accuracy left a lot to be
desired. \XXX{some data} Current model uses one of the suggested
approaches from \cite{alpaydin2004}, where we make the tree as pure as
possible (no prepruning) and handle overfitting by postpruning the tree.
Removing prepruning didn't have an adverse effect for the final
accuracy. \XXX{data}

When prepruning, we stopped the algorithm by limiting by the results
from the entropy calculation, by columns (features) and rows (messages)
left in a recursion step.  For example, \XXX{more detailed explanation}.

\subsubsection{Postpruning}
\label{sect:postpruning}



\section{Validation of our approach}

\subsection{K-fold cross validation}

We implemented 10-fold cross validation to our classifier.  This
gave more stable values for generalization error when compared to
repeatedly training the classifier without the cross validation.

One part of the training data set was used for postpruning the tree, see
section \ref{sect:postpruning}.

\subsection{Dummy model}
